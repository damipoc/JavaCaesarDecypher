/**
 * RotationCipher contains the methods: rotate, decipher, frequencies, chiSquared.
 * rotate will take the string and n integer and return the rotated string
 * decipher will make use of all the other methods in order to return the decipher string
 * frequency will calculate the frequency of each letter in the decipher text
 * chiSquared will do the equation with knowFreq array and the generated array from frequency in order to get Ï‡squared
